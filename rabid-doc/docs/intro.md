# RABID DAO

```bash
www.rabid-dao.com
```

RaBid is the first blockchain platform dedicated to competition betting in the world of extreme sports.
With a profit sharing system Within a DAO system.

The beginning of this cycle is marked by the first launches of NFTs, introducing some of the best athletes of various extreme sports while bringing a new kind of stability to the players of these sports, which may remain to this day far from the kind of stability of mainstream sports athletes, but closer now with RABID! The holders of these NFTs will have a monthly distribution of 60% of all revenue from the casino and bookmaker, where the amount received varies depending on the number of NFTs and their rarity.

After the launch of the first pre-sales, the decentralized crypto casino is born with the most classic games of luck, adapted to the theme of extreme sports. With no deposit required to start playing. Unlike all other casinos, if the user does not win the value of his bet will not be a profit of the house or of some kind of owner, in this case, the investment is reverted to distribute to the NFT's holders and also used as a donation for several social interventions.

## NFTs

Once you acquire a Rabid NFT, you become the holder of a monthly passive income, which will be a percentage of the Betting platform and Casino, varying the percentage received according to the rarity of the NFT, where each athlete will have a set of rarities of his NFT, the common, the uncommon, the rare, the legendary and also an unique NFT, the Foil. Besides the monthly passive income, the holder becomes an important influence in all decisions of the system.

## SPORTS BETTING

After the appearance of the bookmakers, it created a new value for the sports involved, almost unlocking a huge flood of people euphorically passionate following the sport who could not bet on their beliefs and understanding of the sport, the people felt involved.

To force this same phenomenon on radical and alternative sports, which do not have so much visibility yet.

However, we also want to end the taboo exercised on bookmakers and the idea that their profits are from unethical marketing and grooming plays, in this case, the bookmaker's profits like the rabid casino are not retained and are 100% distributed to the holders of the NFTâ€™s of the ecosystem as well as in the creation and financing of social projects, and for this to happen it is only possible from an ecosystem inserted in a DAO.
